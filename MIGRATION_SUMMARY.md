## üß™ Test Results

All 21 tests passing:

```bash
‚úì src/features/calculator/__tests__/logic.test.ts (13 tests)
  - Basic calculations
  - Pitch factor application
  - Cladding factor application
  - Opening deductions
  - Roof battens calculation
  - Wall purlins calculation
  - Edge cases (small/large dimensions)
  - Formatting functions
  - Pitch suggestion logic

‚úì test/llm.test.ts (4 tests)
‚úì test/sales.test.ts (4 tests)
```

**Test Coverage**: Core calculation logic, API contracts, edge cases

---

## ‚ôø Accessibility Improvements

### WCAG 2.2 AA Compliance
- ‚úì Semantic HTML with proper heading hierarchy
- ‚úì ARIA labels and roles on all interactive elements
- ‚úì Visible focus indicators (default MUI focus rings)
- ‚úì Minimum 44√ó44px touch targets
- ‚úì Form labels and error messages
- ‚úì Color contrast ratios meet AA standards
- ‚úì Keyboard navigation for all features

### Screen Reader Support
- ‚úì Form field labels and descriptions
- ‚úì Error messages announced
- ‚úì Loading states communicated
- ‚úì Button actions clearly labeled

---

## üîê Security Improvements

### API Key Management
- **Before**: Keys potentially exposed in client code
- **After**: User-supplied keys stored only in localStorage
- ‚úì No server-side key storage
- ‚úì No logging of API keys
- ‚úì Optional persistence (user must opt-in)
- ‚úì Direct OpenAI API calls from browser

### Data Privacy
- ‚úì No sensitive data sent to backend
- ‚úì Calculations performed client-side
- ‚úì No tracking or analytics

---

## üìä Bundle Size

### Production Build
- **CSS**: 8.77 kB (gzipped: 2.38 kB)
- **JavaScript**: 661.79 kB (gzipped: 205.45 kB)
- **HTML**: 0.46 kB (gzipped: 0.29 kB)

**Note**: MUI is a comprehensive design system, so the bundle size is larger than minimal custom CSS. This trade-off provides:
- Consistent, accessible components
- Reduced development time
- Better maintainability
- Industry-standard patterns

### Optimization Opportunities (Future)
- Code splitting with dynamic imports
- Tree-shaking unused MUI components
- Manual chunk splitting for vendor code

---

## üöÄ Deployment

### Build Process
```bash
npm run build        # Vite production build
npm run test         # Run all tests
npm run deploy:prod  # Deploy to Vercel
```

### Environment Variables
Optional (for legacy backend only):
```env
GROK_API_KEY=your_grok_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
```

**Note**: The new UI uses client-side OpenAI calls, so these are no longer required for the calculator to function.
