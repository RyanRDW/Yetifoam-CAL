# üìò Yetifoam Calculator V2.0 - Staff User Guide

## üöÄ Getting Started

**Website:** https://yetifoam-cal.vercel.app

The Yetifoam Calculator helps you quickly calculate spray foam areas and generate professional sales talking points for customer conversations.

---

## üìê Part 1: Using the Calculator

### Step 1: Enter Shed Dimensions
1. **Length:** Enter the shed length in meters (e.g., 12)
2. **Width:** Enter the shed width in meters (e.g., 8)
3. **Wall Height:** Enter the wall height in meters (e.g., 3)

üí° **Tip:** Click on any dimension field to see a visual guide of what to measure.

### Step 2: Select Roof Pitch
Click on one of the 6 pitch angle buttons:
- 5¬∞ (very shallow)
- 10¬∞ (shallow)
- 15¬∞ (moderate)
- 22¬∞ (steep)
- 25¬∞ (very steep)
- 30¬∞ (extremely steep)

üí° **Tip:** If unsure, 15¬∞ is most common for standard sheds.

### Step 3: Choose Cladding Type
Click on the image button:
- **Corrugated** (wavy sheets) - adds 20% to spray area
- **Monoclad** (flat sheets) - no additional area

### Step 4: Configure Members (Optional)
- **Roof Member Spacing:** Select spacing of roof beams (e.g., 900mm, 1200mm)
- **Wall Member Spacing:** Select spacing of wall studs (e.g., 600mm, 900mm)

These affect the deductions for structural members.

### Step 5: Spray Options (Optional)
Check these boxes if applicable:
- ‚òë **Spray Roof Battens:** Include battens in spray calculation
- ‚òë **Spray Wall Purlins:** Include purlins in spray calculation

### Step 6: Add Openings (Optional)
1. Click **"Manage Openings"** button
2. Click **"Add Opening"**
3. Select opening type:
   - Standard Door (2.1m √ó 0.9m)
   - Roller Door Small (2.4m √ó 2.4m)
   - Roller Door Medium (2.7m √ó 3.0m)
   - Roller Door Large (3.0m √ó 4.0m)
   - Window (1.2m √ó 1.0m)
   - Custom (enter your own dimensions)
4. Click **"Save"**
5. Repeat for additional openings
6. Click **"Done"** when finished

üí° **Tip:** Openings are automatically deducted from the total spray area.

### Step 7: Calculate
1. Click the **"Calculate"** button
2. Results appear showing:
   - **Total Spray Area** (highlighted in the center)
   - **Configuration Summary** (left side)
   - **Area Breakdown** (right side - roof, walls, battens, purlins)

## ü§ñ Part 2: Using the AI Sales Assistant (NEW!)

The AI Sales Assistant helps you generate professional talking points for customer conversations. It has been significantly upgraded with **26 preset topics** covering all common customer concerns.

### What's New in V2.0?

**9 New Topics Added:**
1. **Dust Degradation** - How dust kills competitor products
2. **Structural Benefits** - Strength improvements (300% wind uplift, 124-191% racking)
3. **Air Sealing / Air Leakage** - 58% winter heat loss, 83% reduction
4. **Thermal Bridging** - Steel conducts 1,250x faster, up to 40% efficiency loss
5. **Total Cost of Ownership** - 10-year comparison ($25,750 vs $60,350)
6. **Space Loss** - Competitors steal 150-200mm, Yetifoam retains 100%
7. **Manufacturer Fraud / Deception** - How competitors mislead with lab R-values
8. **Victoria Climate Specific** - Melbourne 6:1 heating-to-cooling ratio, dew point data
9. **Environmental Impact** - Zero VOCs, lowest carbon footprint

**Original 17 Topics Still Available:**
Condensation, Rust, Roof Only, Reflective Foil, Foil Board, Summer Heat, Winter Cold, Anti-con, Too Expensive, Can DIY, Fire, Air-Cell, Batt Walls, Vapour Barrier, Air Barrier, Leaking, Noisy

### How to Use the AI Sales Assistant

#### Method 1: Quick Single Topic (For Simple Questions)

**Example:** Customer asks about condensation

1. Scroll down to the **"Sales Assistant"** section
2. Click on the **"Condensation"** topic chip (it turns blue when selected)
3. Click **"Generate Sales Points"**
4. Wait 1-3 seconds
5. **Result:** You'll get 3-5 professional statements about condensation that you can say directly to the customer

**Sample Output:**
```
Yetifoam eliminates condensation 100% by creating a warm surface above the dew point,
so moisture never condenses on your metal surfaces. This completely prevents rust from
forming on the interior of your shed. Competitor products like Anti-con and fibreglass
are NOT vapour barriers, so condensation will still form behind them causing ongoing
rust issues.
```

#### Method 2: Multi-Topic Selection (For Complex Conversations)

**Example:** Customer asks about Anti-con, mentions condensation, and says "too expensive"

1. Click on **"Anti-con"** topic chip (turns blue)
2. Click on **"Condensation"** topic chip (also turns blue)
3. Click on **"Too Expensive"** topic chip (also turns blue)
4. Click **"Generate Sales Points"**
5. Wait 2-4 seconds (slightly longer for multiple topics)
6. **Result:** You'll get 9-15 statements addressing ALL THREE topics separately

**Why Use Multiple Topics?**
- Covers all customer concerns in one response
- Saves time (one click vs. three separate requests)
- AI provides comprehensive answers that connect the topics logically

üí° **Pro Tip:** Select 2-4 topics at once for best results. The AI addresses each topic with 3-5 statements.

#### Method 3: Custom Questions

**Example:** Customer has a unique situation not covered by presets

1. Scroll to the **"Additional Questions or Context"** text box
2. Type your specific question or context:
   ```
   Customer has a 5-year-old shed with rust problems on the roof.
   They're considering Anti-con but worried about warranty.
   ```
3. (Optional) Also select relevant preset topics like "Rust" and "Anti-con"
4. Click **"Generate Sales Points"**
5. **Result:** AI combines preset knowledge with your custom context

#### Method 4: Create Your Own Topic Buttons

**Example:** You often discuss warranties with customers

1. Click the **"Add Topic"** button (next to "Quick Topics:")
2. Type your topic name: `Warranty`
3. Press **Enter** or click **"Add"**
4. Your custom topic appears as a new chip
5. Use it like any preset topic

üí° **Note:** Custom topics are saved while you use the calculator but reset when you refresh the page.
