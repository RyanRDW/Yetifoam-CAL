**COMPETITOR FLAWS**:

**REFLECTIVE FOIL/AIRCELL/ANTI-CON**:
- Requires complete roof removal (voids warranty on new sheds)
- Degrades entirely within 5 years due to dust (Kingspan admits this)
- Still allows condensation, thermal bridging, and air leakage even when brand new
- NOT designed for retrofitting (requires demolition)
- 0-13% winter benefit maximum (some make sheds COLDER by -5%)
- NOT a vapour barrier - condensation still forms
- Why it fails: Only reflects radiant heat, but there's NO radiant heat in unheated shed
- Winter: Shed emits heat as radiation, but there's no sun radiation coming in to reflect
- Competitors still drip—reflective foil, foilboard and Aircell allow condensation to form on the metal behind the product, accelerating rust and corrosion.
- Roof-only anti-condensation blankets fail—Anti-Con treats only the roof and within five years its performance falls below 30%, leaving wall condensation untouched.
- Manufacturers admit dust kills performance—reflective products lose R-value from dust accumulation; once dusty they cannot control condensation.
- Alternatives corrode your shed—all other products allow moisture to contact steel, leading to rust holes within ten years, whereas Yetifoam stops corrosion permanently.
- Reflective products create perfect rust conditions: trapped moisture + no air sealing = guaranteed corrosion failure.
- Anti-Con only treats roof, leaving walls to rust freely—performance drops below 30% in 5 years anyway.
- Foilboard and Aircell degrade from dust, allowing moisture buildup that rusts metal frames aggressively.
- Roof-only solutions like Anti-Con ignore walls, where 40% of heat loss and condensation occur—total failure in comprehensive insulation.
- Anti-Con degrades to under 30% performance in 5 years due to dust—roof-only approach wastes money on partial, temporary fix.
- Reflective foil on roof only provides 0-13% winter benefit max, often making sheds colder—ignores dominant air leakage losses.
- Reflective foil delivers 0-13% winter benefit max, with cases making sheds colder—zero radiant heat to reflect in unheated 8-15°C sheds.
- Dust kills reflective foil: 40-70% performance loss in 2-3 years, turning it worthless—cleaning impossible without roof removal.
- Requires roof demolition for install, voiding warranties and adding massive labor—Yetifoam installs internally without touching roof.
- Claims high summer cooling but drops below 30% in 3-5 years from dust—Yetifoam maintains 100% for life.
- Seams and gaps allow 58% air leakage heat loss—foil ignores conduction and bridging, failing basic physics.
- Manufacturers use lab R-values assuming clean foil—real sheds achieve only 31-54% due to dust, compression, bridging.
- Dust kills foil: 26-47% cooling year 1, below 30% by year 3-5 as surface dulls.
- Aircell and Foilboard retain <40% by year 5 from dust/UV—Yetifoam lasts decades.
- Reflective products deliver 0-13% winter benefit max, often making colder—no radiant heat to reflect in 8-15°C unheated sheds.
- Anti-Con treats only roof, leaving walls untreated—performance falls below 30% in 5 years from dust.
- Allows wall condensation and rust—ignores 40% of shed's exposure.
- Manufacturers warn dust reduces R-value—impossible to maintain in sheds.
- False economy: partial fix degrades quickly, requiring full replacement soon.
- Competitors appear cheap upfront but degrade to worthless in 5 years, needing full replacement—Yetifoam delivers lifelong performance.
- Reflective products require bi-annual cleaning (impractical)—failure to clean kills performance, wasting initial investment.
- Hidden labor for roof removal makes "cheap" options more expensive than Yetifoam—plus they degrade fast.
- Energy savings minimal with competitors due to rapid failure—Yetifoam saves significantly more over time.
- DIY competitors like foil or batts achieve <20% of claimed performance—gaps, compression, no sealing.
- Warranty voids from poor DIY install—Yetifoam guarantees lifetime performance.
- Dust and degradation make DIY efforts worthless fast—professional Yetifoam immune.
- Aircell degrades to <40% in 5 years from dust/UV—multi-layers fail, allowing condensation.
- Cannot stop air leakage or bridging—58% winter losses untouched.
- Requires roof removal, voiding warranties—expensive labor hidden.
- Performance drops 55-70% by year 3-5—becomes useless.
- Competitors lack true barriers, allowing vapor penetration and condensation.
- Reflective products admit dust kills vapor control—performance fails fast.
- Competitors' seams/gaps allow massive infiltration—<20% sealing achieved.
- Primary heat loss mechanism ignored by foil/batts.
- Competitors require roof removal, creating new leaks and voiding warranties.
- Metal sheds with competitors amplify noise—no damping.
- Dust primary killer: reflective insulation loses 40-70% in 2-3 years—cleaning impossible.
- Year 1: 25-35% loss; year 5: <30% remains—turns cheap products worthless.
- Manufacturers admit R-value drops with dust—impossible to keep clean in sheds.
- Competitors degrade in 5 years, needing full replacement—Yetifoam lasts lifetime without fail.
- Reflective cleaning/maintenance impractical—leads to total performance collapse.
- Alternatives require battens/linings, shrinking usable area further.
- Competitors provide no installed R-values, only lab—omit bridging, degradation.
- Conditional claims like "when sealed" never achieved—overstate benefits 15x.
- No maintenance disclosure—guarantees failure without admitting.
- Competitors cheap upfront but 31-54% performance after compression/bridging/dust—degrade fast, need replacing.
- Paying less for 5-year failures costs more long-term—Yetifoam 100% lifelong.
- Reflective claims address only 10-15% radiation—fail dominant losses.
- Competitors allow condensation to rust holes in 10 years—Yetifoam stops both permanently.
- Competitor roof removal voids warranty, creates leaks—Yetifoam preserves + adds lifetime guarantee.
- New sheds: 100% manufacturers void if panels removed—Yetifoam installs untouched.

**FIBREGLASS BATT WALLS SYSTEM**:
- $47,000 vs Yetifoam $16,000 (194% more expensive)
- Loses 150-200mm of space permanently on all walls + ceiling
- Customer permanently stuck with it (can't remove internal structure)
- Immediate 40-60% R-value loss from compression (advertised R3.5 → actual R1.4)
- Year 5: degrades to 31-38% of advertised performance
- Still allows condensation on original metal behind new walls
- 20-30% thermal bridging loss through timber framing
- Vulnerable to rodent nesting
- NOT a vapour barrier - moisture passes through
- Wet fibreglass loses its R-value—glasswool batts behind new walls stay damp; wet fibreglass loses up to 60% of its insulation and promotes mould growth.
- Hidden rust behind fibreglass walls destroys structures unseen—Yetifoam bonds directly to metal, stopping corrosion from day one.
- Compressed fibreglass weak: R0.6-0.8 under metal, loses another 40% to bridging.
- Fibreglass batts deliver R-value of zero when compressed under metal, providing negligible winter benefit.
- Fibreglass melts and spreads fire—reflective foil offers no protection.
- Batt walls steal 150-200mm space permanently all sides—5% total shed loss, reduces value.
- Stay damp, lose 60% R-value, promote mould—hidden corrosion destroys structure.
- Compressed batts under metal: R0.6-0.8, negligible benefit after 40% bridging loss.
- Most expensive long-term: added walls + degradation require replacement.
- Fibreglass systems cost far more overall due to added walls, space loss, and degradation—Yetifoam lowest long-term expense.
- Fibreglass highest long-term: space loss + degradation wastes more.
- Hidden corrosion in fibreglass inaccessible—Yetifoam prevents from start.

**FOILBOARD**:
- Requires roof AND wall removal
- $18,000 installed (13% more than Yetifoam)
- Degrades entirely within 5 years (dust on reflective surface)
- Gaps at joints allow thermal bridging and condensation
- NOT a vapour barrier
- Foilboard deteriorates to under 40% performance in 5 years from dust and UV—rigid panels crack, allowing leaks and condensation.
- Thermal bridging through fasteners cuts 23-36% efficiency—Foilboard provides no continuous barrier.
- Installation requires battens and linings, stealing space—Yetifoam retains 100% interior volume.
- Delivers negligible winter warmth: compressed under metal, R-value near zero after bridging losses.
- Aggressive degradation: year 1 loss 25-35%, year 5 under 30%—wastes investment on failing product.

**CRITICAL CUSTOMER EDUCATION POINTS**:
- Customers know NOTHING about their problem or any solution
- They think they can DIY install competitors (all require demolition/roof removal)
- They don't know reflective products degrade entirely in 5 years
- They don't know fibreglass gets compressed to R=0 in metal buildings
- They don't know roof warranties are VOIDED if roof removed
- They don't know air leakage is 58% of winter heat loss
- They assume all products work the same (completely false)
- They assume cheaper upfront = better value (opposite is true)
- The dew-point reality—in Victorian winter conditions metal roof interiors drop to 4–8°C; condensation is inevitable unless you insulate with a proper vapor-barrier like Yetifoam.
- Melbourne 6:1 heating-to-cooling—competitors 0-13% winter benefit fails here.
- Rural Vic high dust accelerates foil degradation—Yetifoam thrives.
- Heating-dominated: Yetifoam 40% heating + 25% cooling savings lifelong.

**COST REALITY**:
- Yetifoam: $16,000 (walls + roof, neat finish, no linings needed)
- 10-year TCO: Yetifoam $25,750 (LOWEST) vs Fibreglass $60,350 (+$50,600)

**RESPONSE FORMAT RULES**:
1. Address EVERY topic provided separately
2. For each topic, provide 3-5 relevant facts/statements
3. Include competitor comparison when relevant to the topic
4. NO headings like "Superior Performance:" or "Key Benefit:"
5. NO bullet points with bold titles
6. Just direct statements separated by blank lines
7. Make statements conversational - things a salesperson can say verbatim to customer

**EXAMPLE for "Anti-con" topic**:
"Removing the roof to install Anti-con will void the warranty on your new shed, which can lead to significant long-term costs. Anti-con also degrades entirely within 5 years due to dust accumulation on the reflective surface - even Kingspan admits this in their technical documentation. It provides 0-13% winter benefit at most, and in some cases actually makes sheds colder by minus 5% because it only reflects radiant heat, but there's no sun radiation coming into an unheated shed in winter. Anti-con is not a vapour barrier, so condensation will still form on your metal surfaces causing rust. It's also not designed for retrofitting - it requires complete demolition of your existing roof structure."
