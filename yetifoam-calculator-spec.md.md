## CALCULATION FORMULAS

### 1. Pitch Factor

**Purpose:** Accounts for roof slope when calculating roof area.

**Formula:**
F = 1 / cos(θ)

**Pitch Factor Values:**
| Pitch | Calculation | Factor |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 5°    | 1/cos(5°)   | 1.004  |
| 10°   | 1/cos(10°)  | 1.015  |
| 15°   | 1/cos(15°)  | 1.035  |
| 22°   | 1/cos(22°)  | 1.082  |
| 25°   | 1/cos(25°)  | 1.103  |
| 30°   | 1/cos(30°)  | 1.155  |

**Unknown Pitch Auto-Suggestion Rules:**
- If W ≥ 9m → suggest 10°
- If 6m ≤ W < 9m → suggest 15°
- If W < 6m → suggest 22°

### 2. Geometry Calculations

**Rafter Length (slope length per side):**
s = (W / 2) × F
Where:
- W = shed width (m)
- F = pitch factor
- s = rafter length from eave to ridge

**Rise (apex height above wall):**
rise = (W / 2) × tan(θ)

### 3. Surface Areas

**Roof Base Area:**
A_roof_base = L × W

**Side Walls Area:**
A_side_walls = 2 × (L × H)

**Gable Walls Rectangular Area:**
A_gable_rect = 2 × (W × H)

**Gable Triangles Area:**
A_gable_triangles = W × rise
(Always included - not optional)

### 4. Multipliers

**Pitch Factor Application:**
Applies to: Roof base + Gable triangles
A_roof_pitched = A_roof_base × F
A_gable_tri_pitched = A_gable_triangles × F

**Cladding Factor:**
- Corrugated: 1.2×
- Monoclad: 1.0×

Applies to: ALL surfaces (roof, walls, gable triangles) AFTER pitch factor
A_surface_final = A_surface_pitched × cladding_factor

### 5. Member Counts & Spray Bands

**Spacing Presets (field measurements):**

| Surface | Cladding | Member Type | Spacing |
|---------|----------|-------------|---------|
| Roof    | Corrugated | Top-hat   | 1200mm  |
| Roof    | Corrugated | C-channel | 1500mm  |
| Roof    | Monoclad   | Top-hat   | 1500mm  |
| Roof    | Monoclad   | C-channel | 1500mm  |
| Walls   | Both       | Top-hat   | 1200mm  |
| Walls   | Both       | C-channel | 1200mm  |

**Wall Member Counts:**

Horizontal lines (side walls):
n_side = ceil(H / S_wall) + 1
LM_side = n_side × (2 × L)

Horizontal lines (gable walls):
n_gable = ceil(H / S_wall) + 1
LM_gable = n_gable × (2 × W)

Total wall purlins:
LM_wall_total = LM_side + LM_gable

**Roof Member Counts:**

Lines per roof side:
n_roof_side = ceil(s / S_roof) + 1
LM_roof = 2 × n_roof_side × L

**Member Spray Band Areas:**

Roof battens (Top-hat only):
A_roof_bands = LM_roof × 0.12m × 0.9

Wall purlins (C-channel only):
A_wall_bands = LM_wall_total × 0.18m × 0.9

**CRITICAL:** Member spray bands do NOT get pitch or cladding multipliers applied.

### 6. Opening Deductions

**Opening Library:**

| Type | Area (m²) | Deducted From |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Single Roller | 5.04 | Gable walls |
| Double Roller | 10.08 | Gable walls |
| High Roller | 9.00 | Gable walls |
| Large/Industrial Roller | 23.10 | Gable walls |
| PA Door | 1.67 | Side walls |
| Window | 1.44 | Side walls |
| Sliding Door Single | 4.41 | Side walls |
| Sliding Door Double | 8.82 | Side walls |
| Laserlight | 0.9m × rafter_length × qty | Roof |
| Custom Deduction | 1.0 per increment | Side walls |

**Laserlight Calculation:**
A_laserlight_total = 0.9 × s × quantity

**Total Deductions by Surface:**
Opening_deduct_gable = sum(roller_doors)
Opening_deduct_side = sum(PA + windows + sliding + custom)
Opening_deduct_roof = sum(laserlights)

### 7. Final Calculation Sequence

**Step-by-step:**

Calculate base areas:
A_roof_base = L × W
A_side_walls = 2 × (L × H)
A_gable_rect = 2 × (W × H)

- 10° → 1.015
- 15° → 1.035
- 22° → 1.082
- 25° → 1.103
- 30° → 1.155

s = (W / 2) × F
Where: W = shed width (m), F = pitch factor, s = rafter length from eave to ridge

**Rise (apex height above wall):**
rise = (W / 2) × tan(θ)

Wall purlins (C-channel only): A_wall_bands = LM_wall_total × 0.18m × 0.9
CRITICAL: Member spray bands do NOT get pitch or cladding multipliers applied.

### 2.6 Opening Deductions
**Opening Library:**
Single Roller: 5.04 m² (Gable walls)
Double Roller: 10.08 m² (Gable walls)
High Roller: 9.00 m² (Gable walls)
Large/Industrial Roller: 23.10 m² (Gable walls)

Custom Deduction: 1.0 m² per increment (Side walls)

**Laserlight Calculation:** A_laserlight_total = 0.9 × s × quantity

### 2.7 Final Calculation Sequence
Step 1: Calculate base areas (L×W for roof, L×H for walls, W×H for gables, W×rise for triangles)
Step 2: Apply pitch factor to roof base and gable triangles
Step 3: Apply cladding factor to ALL surfaces (post-pitch)
Step 4: Sum all surface areas: A_surfaces_total = A_roof + A_side_walls + A_gable_rect + A_gable_tri
Step 5: Deduct openings by surface type: A_surfaces_net = A_surfaces_total - openings
Step 6: Calculate member spray bands (independent): A_members = A_roof_bands + A_wall_bands (if enabled)
Step 7: Calculate net total: A_net_total = A_surfaces_net + A_members

**Example Calculation (12m × 9m × 3m, 10° pitch, Corrugated, Top-hat roof, C-channel walls, 1 single roller, 2 windows):**
Pitch factor: 1.015
Rise: (9/2) × tan(10°) = 0.793m
Rafter: (9/2) × 1.015 = 4.568m
Roof base: 12 × 9 = 108 m²
Side walls: 2 × (12 × 3) = 72 m²
Gable rect: 2 × (9 × 3) = 54 m²
Gable tri: 9 × 0.793 = 7.137 m²
Roof pitched: 108 × 1.015 = 109.62 m²
Gable tri pitched: 7.137 × 1.015 = 7.244 m²
Apply cladding 1.2×: Roof 109.62 × 1.2 = 131.54 m², Walls 72 × 1.2 = 86.4 m², Gable rect 54 × 1.2 = 64.8 m², Gable tri 7.244 × 1.2 = 8.69 m²
Surfaces total: 131.54 + 86.4 + 64.8 + 8.69 = 291.43 m²
Openings: Single roller 5.04 m² (gable) + Windows 2 × 1.44 = 2.88 m² (side) = 7.92 m²
Surfaces net: 291.43 - 7.92 = 283.51 m²
Roof battens: ceil(4.568/1.2)+1 = 5 lines, 5 × 12 = 60m, 60 × 0.12 × 0.9 = 6.48 m²
Wall purlins: Side ceil(3/1.2)+1 = 4 lines, 4 × 24 = 96m; Gable 4 × 18 = 72m; Total 168m × 0.18 × 0.9 = 27.22 m²
Members total: 6.48 + 27.22 = 33.7 m²
NET TOTAL: 283.51 + 33.7 = 317.21 m²

4. LAYOUT SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
4.1 Panel Structure
Top Level: App contains LeftPanel (Input) and RightPanelStack (all other panels)
LeftPanel: Fixed vertical accordion of collapsible sections
RightPanelStack: Resizable stack of panels (Results, Sales Insights, Preview, Help)
Drag Handles: Between all panels for manual resizing
4.2 Panel States
Expanded: Full content visible, takes defined height/width percentage
Collapsed: Minimized to tab (40px height), shows title only
Hidden: Not rendered (not used - all panels always present)
4.3 Auto-Collapse Triggers
Location Section: Collapses when suburb selected
Dimensions Section: Collapses when all 3 fields filled (L, W, H)
Pitch Section: Collapses when tile selected or Unknown confirmed
Cladding Section: Collapses when type selected
Members Section: Collapses when both roof and wall types selected
Spray Options Section: Collapses when any checkbox interacted with
Openings Section: Collapses when modal closed (if openings added)
Collapsed Display Format:
Location: "📍 [Suburb] ▶"
Dimensions: "📏 [L]×[W]×[H]m ▶"
Pitch: "📐 [Angle]° ▶" (with ⚠️ if assumed)
Cladding: "📋 [Type] ▶"
Members: "🔧 [Roof type] roof / [Wall type] wall ▶"
Options: "⚙️ ✓ [enabled options] ▶"
Openings: "🚪 [count] openings ▶"
4.4 Calculate Button Animation Sequence
Timing: 800ms total
0-200ms: All input sections collapse simultaneously (parallel)
200-400ms: Left panel shrinks from 40% to 25%
400-600ms: Results panel expands from minimized tab (animates height)
600-800ms: Sales Insights panel expands below Results
Concurrent: Preview panel minimizes to tab, space reflows
